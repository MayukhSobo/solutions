redis is required for DB operations.

train.csv and test.csv should be located at bestbuy/data-big/

To train, run python train_redis.py

To make a submission file, run python make_submit.py

RAM requirement: train_redis.py will make a redis DB of 400MB. A linux
computer with 2G RAM should be able to run the code. 

Run time: for a Q9400 cpu @3GHz,
train_redis takes 10min.
make_submit takes 45min at the first run. After that, it only takes 11min
since the query-matching results are cached.

score: 0.5997 for private one, which would take the first place.
